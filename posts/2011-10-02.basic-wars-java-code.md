This summer has been a Summer of Code.

Over the summer I started working on a project for a coding competition called [ICS Summer Of Code][0]. I had no idea what I was going to write but I knew it couldn't be a tiny project, but I only had 2 months to complete it. I decided a game would be fun since I haven't written a lot of games in the past, and it would yield some graphics experience. I chose Java since I am most comfortable with it and time could be an issue. My final product is a two player, turn based strategy game called Basic Wars which you can download on [GitHub][1].
