DirectoryLib is open to the public...available on GitHub now!

When developing a new app or tool at Western Digital, we often need a way to authenticate users.Active Directory keeps all this information such as the user's name, email, password, etc. But how can I access this information? What if the user types the wrong password? What about if the user's password is expired? What about if their *username* changes!?!

Introducing [DirectoryLib][0], the library that lets you talk to Active Directory.

### Open Source

Western Digital started an open source policy recently, and my request to open source our [DirectoryLib][0] tool has been granted. This is wonderful news because I think open source will greatly improve code quality and reduce the siloed development that happens in different departments. So much of our code is written in-house where few eyes see it, and few people know about the project/library. We have teams solving the same problem and wasting resources. Publishing to [nuget][1] will increase visibility and hopefully we can focus our efforts on solving real problems.

Check out [DirectoryLib][0] on GitHub!
