The first major update to this site has been released! Introducing ceriously 2.0! Now with twice the dogs!

Or better yet, ceriously 2.0.0! Now with [Semantic Versioning][0]!

The most notable change in this version is heavy use of [Materialize CSS][1], an implementation of Google's Material Design. There are also many parallax dogs wearing silly glasses to fit the "serious" theme. Compare [this June 2015 snapshot][2] to the current design [August 2015 snapshot][3]. It was a much needed face lift.
