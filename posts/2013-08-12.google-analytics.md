I recently added Google Analytics to this website because I had no idea what kind of traffic I was getting. The numbers are in and they were not far off from what I was expecting.

I get about 50 unique hits a month (about 1 or 2 a day). The majority of those are for my [HTML5 Dice][0] page which I wrote back when the Canvas API was introduced. I decided to search "html5 dice" and was shocked to find that my site was the first hit on Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. I recognize there isn't a lot of competition but I am still very surprised that I have a top hit on most search engines. So until next time...Google me.
