This quarter has been extremely difficult, but oddly fun. I feel like I have a project due every day and finals are just around the corner.

My final project for CS 122B (Projects in Databases and Web Applications) was to create an Android app that presents questions to the user in the form of a quiz. It sounds easy but there was a small problem; I have been so content with my iPhone, I have never used an Android device for more than a couple minutes. Thankfully, my friend let me have one of his old Android phones and I immediately got to work. It's not currently ready to be in the app store, but you can download my [MovieQuiz][0] app if you want to check it out.
