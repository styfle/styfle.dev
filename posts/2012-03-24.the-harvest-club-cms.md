Winter is over! This quarter, I have been working on a Contact Management System for a non-profit organization called The Harvest Club.

The Harvest Club needed a database to keep track of growers, volunteers, trees, distribution sites in addition to sending bulk email to these groups. I'm happy to say the code has matured to the point where The Harvest Club is now using it on their production site. If you are in the OC and would like to check them out, visit [theharvestclub.org][0]. The project is open source so you can fork it on [GitHub][1] and build your own CMS.
