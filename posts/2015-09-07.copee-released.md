Copee js, a library to copy text from the browser to the clipboard, is available now on GitHub!

Whenever a new version of Google Chrome is released, I like to read the [release notes][0] and [updates][1] to see what's new. I noticed that there was an update to include the [copy command][2] in Chrome 43\. Normally this means IE will get the feature in a couple years, however IE already supported this command since IE 10! This is the holy grail, the feature web app developers have had to [hack][3] around for years to create a user experience that our users expect, and now it's in all major browsers today.

I wanted to gain experience creating front end packages but didn't have anything worth publishing...until now. Check out [copee][4], a module that wraps the new Copy API.
